The first thing I thought was that if the game is going to have any type of theme you first gotta do is think about the background so it
can match the game energy.https://www.gameart2d.com/free-platformer-game-tileset.html. So this would be the background of the game it will
also have is a night time background setting which would be like a bonus level only thing about is that it the game would be more like a
speed level.https://www.gameart2d.com/free-graveyard-platformer-tileset.html. So for the ball I was thinking that the color should be orange
but the difference is that the ball will have small legs almost as if the its jumping. The walls will have tree's that but the swist will be
the tree's will consume your player if he is slow or is low on energy.The ramp theme will have floating platforms that will help you move
around but will hidden traps, The holes will have bonus rounds but will have 10 second end point and each one will be twice as hard as the
last one.
