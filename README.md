Haaaa project
we made a physical prototype of the ramp and decide it will move along with two underlying ''doodads'' kind of like a shelf
we know the shelf will have to eventually be fastened to the doodads,otherwise it will slide off.
No matter our solution to the slide-off problem,we need to create doodads that move up and down along with player input.
The first step is to just make one doodad that moves up and down with player input.
## what button should it be?
